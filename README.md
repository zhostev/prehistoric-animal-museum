## A quiet place to look closely

When my daughter was three, dinosaurs on television made her uneasy. The stories often centred on chases, fights, and “defeating the dinosaur”, leaving little room to simply look at the animal itself.

I wanted to give her a place with no winning or losing and no frightening scene waiting around the corner. A child can choose an animal, turn it around, and listen to a short introduction. A grown-up can add a thought, ask a question, or simply stay beside them.

This museum is not designed to keep children on the screen. Discovering one interesting detail is enough.

## Explore together

- **Look from every side:** drag with a finger or mouse to turn a model, then pinch or scroll to zoom.
- **Listen when you choose:** short English and Mandarin narration never auto-plays.
- **Follow the questions:** the parent guide covers when an animal lived, fossil discovery regions, size, diet, classification, and source references.
- **Use it comfortably:** the responsive layout adapts to phone, tablet, and desktop screen sizes, supports keyboard navigation, and respects reduced-motion settings.

The museum follows the device language on a first visit. You can switch between English and Simplified Chinese at any time; the choice is remembered, and each language has a shareable link.

It is designed mainly for children aged 2–6 with a grown-up nearby, but curiosity matters more than the age label. If an image or sound feels uncomfortable, choose another animal or close the page.

## 31 animals across sea, land, and sky

- **Land:** Stegosaurus, Pachycephalosaurus, Tyrannosaurus rex, Triceratops, Apatosaurus, Gigantoraptor, Woolly mammoth, Maiasaura, Sauropelta, Dilophosaurus, Velociraptor, Parasaurolophus, Smilodon, Spinosaurus, Allosaurus, Baryonyx, Carnotaurus, Ceratosaurus, Compsognathus, and Deinonychus.
- **Sky:** Pteranodon, Rhamphorhynchus, Tupandactylus, and Meganeura.
- **Sea:** Ichthyosaurs, Plesiosaurs, Megalodon, Mosasaurus, Dunkleosteus, Ammonite scan, and Jaekelopterus.

</details>

The ichthyosaur and plesiosaur exhibits represent broader groups of related animals rather than one exact species. Fossils do not preserve every answer, so colours, soft tissue, and some movement are evidence-informed artistic reconstructions rather than exact portraits.

## A calm, private visit

- The application has no sign-in or user profile and does not ask for names, contact details, or children’s information.
- It contains no advertising or analytics scripts, membership, knowledge unlock, or paywall.
- The museum experience makes no runtime calls to AI, advertising, or analytics services; models, images, and narration are prepared static assets.
- No autoplay and no pressure to “finish” the museum.
